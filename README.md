This is a collection of notes that I've created based on courses, write-ups, manuals, etc that I've seen. 

All files in this repository are markdown files I've created to be viewed in[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) . Obsidian is a markdown editor with lots of additional functionality and a large plugin database to fully customize your experience. I'm not sponsored, I just like it a lot and think you should look into it if you haven't already.
