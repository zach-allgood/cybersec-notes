## Summary

AutoRecon is a multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool that performs automated enumeration of services, much like [[nmap]]. It is intended as a time-saving tool for use in CTFs and other penetration testing environments (e.g. OSCP). It may also be useful in real-world engagements.

Example of AutoRecon running

You can acquire this via [https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon).

## Features

- Supports multiple targets in the form of IP addresses, IP ranges (CIDR notation), and resolvable hostnames. IPv6 is also supported.
- Can scan multiple targets concurrently, utilizing multiple processors if they are available.
- Advanced plugin system allowing for easy creation of new scans.
- Customizable port scanning plugins for flexibility in your initial scans.
- Customizable service scanning plugins for further enumeration.
- Suggested manual follow-up commands for when automation makes little sense.
- Ability to limit port scanning to a combination of TCP/UDP ports.
- Ability to skip port scanning phase by suppling information about services which should be open.
- Global and per-scan pattern matching which highlights and extracts important information from the noise.
- An intuitive directory structure for results gathering.
- Full logging of commands that were run, along with errors if they fail.
- A powerful config file lets you use your favorite settings every time.
- A tagging system that lets you include or exclude certain plugins.
- Global and per-target timeouts in case you only have limited time.
- Four levels of verbosity, controllable by command-line options, and during scans using Up/Down arrows.
- Colorized output for distinguishing separate pieces of information. Can be turned off for accessibility reasons.

## Installation

There are three ways to install AutoRecon: pipx, pip, and manually. Before installation using any of these methods, certain requirements need to be fulfilled. If you have not refreshed your apt cache recently, run the following command so you are installing the latest available packages:

```shell
sudo apt update
```

### Python 3

AutoRecon requires the usage of Python 3.8+ and pip, which can be installed on Kali Linux using the following commands:

```shell
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Supporting Packages

Several commands used in AutoRecon reference the SecLists project, in the directory /usr/share/seclists/. You can either manually download the SecLists project to this directory ([https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)), or if you are using Kali Linux (**highly recommended**) you can run the following commands:

```shell
sudo apt install seclists
```

AutoRecon will still run if you do not install SecLists, though several commands may fail, and some manual commands may not run either.

Additionally the following commands may need to be installed, depending on your OS:

```
curl
dnsrecon
enum4linux
feroxbuster
gobuster
impacket-scripts
nbtscan
nikto
nmap
onesixtyone
oscanner
redis-tools
smbclient
smbmap
snmpwalk
sslscan
svwar
tnscmd10g
whatweb
wkhtmltopdf
```

On Kali Linux, you can ensure these are all installed using the following commands:

```
sudo apt install seclists curl dnsrecon enum4linux feroxbuster gobuster impacket-scripts nbtscan nikto nmap onesixtyone oscanner redis-tools smbclient smbmap snmp sslscan sipvicious tnscmd10g whatweb wkhtmltopdf
```

### Installation Method #1: pipx (Recommended)

It is recommended you use `pipx` to install AutoRecon. pipx will install AutoRecon in it's own virtual environment, and make it available in the global context, avoiding conflicting package dependencies and the resulting instability. First, install pipx using the following commands:

```shell
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

You will have to re-source your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file (or open a new tab) after running these commands in order to use pipx.

Install AutoRecon using the following command:

```shell
pipx install git+https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon.git
```

Note that if you want to run AutoRecon using sudo (required for faster SYN scanning and UDP scanning), you have to use _one_ of the following examples:

```shell
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" autorecon [OPTIONS]
sudo $(which autorecon) [OPTIONS]
```

## Usage

AutoRecon uses Python 3 specific functionality and does not support Python 2.

### Verbosity

AutoRecon supports four levels of verbosity:

- (none) Minimal output. AutoRecon will announce when scanning targets starts / ends.
- (-v) Verbose output. AutoRecon will additionally announce when plugins start running, and report open ports and identified services.
- (-vv) Very verbose output. AutoRecon will additionally specify the exact commands which are being run by plugins, highlight any patterns which are matched in command output, and announce when plugins end.
- (-vvv) Very, very verbose output. AutoRecon will output everything. Literally every line from all commands which are currently running. When scanning multiple targets concurrently, this can lead to a ridiculous amount of output. It is not advised to use -vvv unless you absolutely need to see live output from commands.

Note: You can change the verbosity of AutoRecon mid-scan by pressing the up and down arrow keys.

### Results

By default, results will be stored in the ./results directory. A new sub directory is created for every target. The structure of this sub directory is:

```
.
├── exploit/
├── loot/
├── report/
│   ├── local.txt
│   ├── notes.txt
│   ├── proof.txt
│   └── screenshots/
└── scans/
	├── _commands.log
	├── _manual_commands.txt
	├── tcp80/
	├── udp53/
	└── xml/
```

The exploit directory is intended to contain any exploit code you download / write for the target.

The loot directory is intended to contain any loot (e.g. hashes, interesting files) you find on the target.

The report directory contains some auto-generated files and directories that are useful for reporting:

- local.txt can be used to store the local.txt flag found on targets.
- notes.txt should contain a basic template where you can write notes for each service discovered.
- proof.txt can be used to store the proof.txt flag found on targets.
- The screenshots directory is intended to contain the screenshots you use to document the exploitation of the target.

The scans directory is where all results from scans performed by AutoRecon will go. This includes port scans / service detection scans, as well as any service enumeration scans. It also contains two other files:

- _commands.log contains a list of every command AutoRecon ran against the target. This is useful if one of the commands fails and you want to run it again with modifications.
- _manual_commands.txt contains any commands that are deemed "too dangerous" to run automatically, either because they are too intrusive, require modification based on human analysis, or just work better when there is a human monitoring them.

By default, directories are created for each open port (e.g. tcp80, udp53) and scan results for the services found on those ports are stored in their respective directories. You can disable this behavior using the --no-port-dirs command line option, and scan results will instead be stored in the scans directory itself.

If a scan results in an error, a file called _errors.log will also appear in the scans directory with some details to alert the user.

If output matches a defined pattern, a file called _patterns.log will also appear in the scans directory with details about the matched output.

The scans/xml directory stores any XML output (e.g. from Nmap scans) separately from the main scan outputs, so that the scans directory itself does not get too cluttered.
