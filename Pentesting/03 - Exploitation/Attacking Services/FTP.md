# FTP Bounce Attack

An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a PORT command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.

Consider we are targetting an FTP Server FTP_DMZ exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, Internal_DMZ, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the FTP_DMZ server to scan Internal_DMZ using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports. Then, we can use that information as part of our attack against the infrastructure.
