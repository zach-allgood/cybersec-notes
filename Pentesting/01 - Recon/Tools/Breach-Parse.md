Must torrent the breach list, it is very very large. Essentially a massive dump of leaked usernames/passwords.

## Usage
```bash
./breach-parse.sh <domain to search> <file to output> [breach data location]
```

```bash
./breach-parse.sh "<domain to search>|<domain to search>" <file to output>
```
## Examples

```bash
./breach-parse.sh @gmail.com gmail.txt
```

```bash
./breach-parse.sh @gmail.com gmail.txt "~/Downloads/BreachCompilation/data"
```

*You only need to specify \[breach data location] if its not in the expected location (/opt/breach-parse/BreachCompilation/data)*

## Output

Results are output into three files: name-master.txt, name-passwords.txt, name-users.txt. Master is a combination of users/passwords.
