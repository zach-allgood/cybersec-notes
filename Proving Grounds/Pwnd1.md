- Ran nmap
- Found port 80
- Went to homepage, found site was compromised
- Ran ffuf on site to get the following paths:
	- /nothing
	- /hidden_text
	- /robots.txt
- /nothing showed nothing of use
- /hidden_text shows secret.dic
- Running ffuf using secret.dic wordlist found /pwned.vuln
- After viewing page source for /pwned.vuln, found login for FTP
- Logging into FTP found notes.txt and id_rsa
- notes.txt gave name of user, SSH in using id_rsa and name as user
- This gave us a shell, nothing of note in the user directory, but in /home found messenger.sh
- Inspecting messenger.sh found it took input of whatever your message is and output that to /dev/null
- Was able to get /bin/bash to run but only as current user
- ./linpeas.sh ran and found that current user can run messenger.sh as other non-root user
- Ran `sudo -u user /home/messenger.sh`
- In message, ran ``/bin/bash -p`
- `whoami` returns new user
- Ran linpeas as new user, found docker group assigned
- Ran the following docker command to privesc and gain root access:
	- `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh`
- From here we're root and have the whole server in a docker container
- Can find root flag in /root
